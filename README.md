# CIFAR-10 Vehicle & Animal Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch
to classify CIFAR-10 images. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and
tested on real-world smartphone images.

## Dataset
- CIFAR-10 (via torchvision)
- Custom images captured using a smartphone

## Model Architecture
- 3 Convolutional layers
- Batch Normalization
- ReLU activation
- MaxPooling
- Fully connected layers

## Folder Structure

## Results
- Training Accuracy: ~90%
- Model generalizes to real-world images with some confusion due to low resolution

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. The notebook automatically downloads datasets and predicts custom images
